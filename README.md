# NET::ZMQ

## SYNOPSIS

    Net::ZMQ is a Perl6 binding libraru for ZeroMQ 

### Status

    This is early development

### Alternatives

    There is an an earlier project https://github.com/arnsholt/Net-ZMQ         
    I started this one primarily to learn. The older project may be more 
    stable and suitable to your needs.

### ZMQ Versions

Current development is with ZeroMQ 4.2. Unfathomably, version 4
is installed on my system as libzmq.so.5. The NativeCall calls are 
therefore tp v5.

### Design Goals

    coexistence of multiple zmq versions
    perlish calling conventions
    calling

### Structure

####  Net::ZMQ::V4::Constants

    holds all the constants from zmq.h v4. They are grouped with tags.
    The tags not loaded by default are
    :EVENT
    :DEPRECATED
    :DRAFT 	Experimental, not in stable version
    :RADIO
    :IOPLEX	multiplexing
    :SECURITY

####  Net::ZMQ::V4::LowLevel

    holds NativeCall bindings for all the functions in zmq.h
    the calls are machine generated and the only check is that
    they compile.
    ZMQ_LOW_LEVEL_FUNCTIONS_TESTED holds a list of the calls used
    in the module so far. loading  Net::ZMQ::V4::Version prints it

####  Net::ZMQ::V4::Version
    use in order to chack version compatibility
    exports
	verion()
	version-major()

####
    Net::ZMQ::Context and
    Net::ZMQ::Socket
    provide a higher level OO interface

    Context
	         .new( [throw-everything => False] )   # set to True to throw non fatal errors
	         .terminate() 			                   # manually release all resources (gc would do that)
	         .shutdown()			                     # close all sockets
	         .get-option(name)                     # get Context option
	         .set-option(name, value)	             # set Context option

	options can also be accessed through methods with the name of the option
	with/without get- and set- prefixes.
	e.g get: .get-io-threads()  .io-threads()
	    set: .set-io-threads(2) .io-threads(2)
	Net::ZMQ::ContextOptions holds the dispatch table 

    Socket
	         .new( Context, Type, [throw-everything => False])
                                              # set to True to throw non fatal errors
	         .close()					                  # (GC does that)
	         .bind( uri )
	         .connect( uri )
	         .unbind( uri )
	         .disconnect( uri )
	         .send(msg, [flags] )              # flags are combined with +
	         .receive(msg, [flags] )           # flags are combined with + 	

	         .get-option-int(name)	      		# get Socket integer options
	         .get-option-cstr(name)				    # get Socket null-terminated options
	         .get-option-buf(name) 			    	# get Socket binary data options

	         .set-option-int(name, value)			# set Socket integer options
	         .set-option-cstr(name, value)	 	# set Socket null-terminated options
	         .set-option-buf(name, value)     # set Socket binary data options

	options can also be accessed through methods with the name of the option
	with/without get- and set- prefixes.
	e.g get: .get-identity()  .identity()
	    set: .set-identity(id) .identity(id)
	Net::ZMQ::SocketOptions holds the dispatch table
